# Image-Captioning-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model that can automatically generate captions for input images. The model has been trained on a large dataset of images and their corresponding captions, and can now generate captions for new images it has never seen before. We use pretrained ResNet50 model to get meaningful features from each image and then Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to reach to a final text generation model.

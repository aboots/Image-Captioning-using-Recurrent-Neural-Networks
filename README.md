# Image-Captioning-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
This project presents an automated image captioning system built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The system is trained on a large dataset of images and corresponding captions, enabling it to generate relevant captions for new, unseen images. The model utilizes the pretrained ResNet50 for extracting meaningful image features, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for effective text generation.
